        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
          Gobi or cauliflower is a weekly veggie that I get at home. Usually, I
          try different recipes with gobi at times. On most occasions, I make
          this Aloo gobi. If not aloo gobi, then I make gobi paratha or a Mix
          veg curry or the cauliflower is added to biryani, pulao or pav bhaji.
        </p>
        <p>
          The gobi masala recipe is easy and simple to make. Since the curry has
          more restaurant like flavors it goes very well with rotis, naan,
          tandoori roti or cumin rice or just plain steamed rice.

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <h3>Preparation For Gobi Masala</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Chop the cauliflower into medium florets. Rinse well and keep aside.
          </li>
          <li>Heat 3 cups water with salt till its starts boiling.</li>
          <li>
            Switch off and add the florets in the hot water. Cover and keep
            aside for 15-20 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            In the meantime, chop the onion and crush the ginger-garlic in a
            mortar-pestle.
          </li>
          <li>
            Also grind the tomato-cashews to a smooth paste on a high speed in a
            blender with very little water. If there is too much water, then the
            mixture starts spluttering when sauting it.
          </li>
          <li>Keep the tomato-cashew paste aside.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Sauteing Gobi For Making Gobi Masala</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Drain the cauliflower florets and keep aside and gently wipe them
            dry.
          </li>
          <li>Heat oil in a kadai or wok till it starts shimmering.</li>
          <li>
            Add the blanched cauliflower florets to the oil and saute on a low
            to medium flame till they start getting light brown spots on them.
          </li>
          <li>This takes approx 8 to 10 mins.</li>
          <li>Then remove the sauted cauliflower and keep aside.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Making Gobi Masala</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            In the same pan, add 2 tbsp oil. Add the bay leaf and caraway seeds.
          </li>
          <li>Fry for a few seconds or till the oil become aromatic.</li>
          <li>
            Add the chopped onions and saute till the onions get golden and
            caramelized.
          </li>
          <li>
            Then add the ginger-garlic paste and saute for a few seconds till
            the raw aroma of ginger-garlic goes away.
          </li>
          <li>Add the tomato-cashew paste and stir.</li>
          <li>
            Add the spice powders – coriander, cumin, red chili, garam masala
            and turmeric.
          </li>
          <li>
            Saute stirring often till the oil starts to leave the sides of the
            masala.
          </li>
          <li>
            The whole masala paste will clump together and you will see oil
            clearly leaving the sides.
          </li>
          <li>
            This is an important step as if not done properly, the flavors don't
            come through in the dish.
          </li>
          <li>Switch off the stove and then add the whisked yogurt.</li>
          <li>
            Stir very well and then add 1 to 1.5 cups water. do add water as
            required. here I get cauliflower which takes more time to cook. Thus
            I add more water. If the cauliflower takes less time to cook, then
            add less water.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you have fried the cauliflower more than what is mentioned in the
            recipe, then also you will have to add less water as the cauliflower
            will be already cooked. So just add enough water to get a medium
            consistency gravy. Let it come to a boil. Then add the cauliflower
            and simmer for a minute.
          </li>
          <li>Stir again and keep the kadai or pan on the fire again.</li>
          <li>Now add the sauteed cauliflower florets plus salt.</li>
          <li>Stir and cover the kadai or pan with a tight lid.</li>
          <li>
            Cook the cauliflower masala on low to medium flame for approx 10 to
            15 minutes or till they are cooked completely.
          </li>
          <li>Keep on checking at intervals.</li>
          <li>
            Lastly add the crushed kasuri methi, cream and a pinch of nutmeg.
            Stir the curry and switch off the fire.
          </li>
          <li>Serve gobi masala hot with rotis, naan or rice.</li>
