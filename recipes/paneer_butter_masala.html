        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <h3>Preparation</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Soak cashews in a hot water for 20 to 30 minutes. When the cashews
            are soaking, you can prep the other ingredients like chopping
            tomatoes, preparing ginger-garlic paste, slicing paneer etc.
          </li>
          <li>
            Then drain and add the soaked cashews in a blender or mixer-grinder.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add 2 to 3 tablespoons water and blend to a smooth paste without any
            tiny bits or pieces of cashews.
          </li>
          <li>
            In the same blender add the roughly chopped tomatoes. No need to
            blanch the tomatoes before blending.
          </li>
          <li>
            Blend to a smooth tomato puree. Keep aside. Don’t add any water
            while blending the tomatoes.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Making Tomato Gravy</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Melt butter in a pan on a low flame. Add tej patta and fry for 2 to
            3 seconds or till the oil become fragrant.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add ginger-garlic paste and sauté for some seconds till the raw
            aroma disappears.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the tomato puree and stir well. Cook for 5 to 6 minutes. Then
            add kashmiri red chili powder and stir again. Continue to sauté till
            the oil starts to leave the sides of the tomato paste. The tomato
            paste will thicken considerably and will start coming together as
            one whole lump.
          </li>
          <li>
            Then add cashew paste and stir well. Sauté the cashew paste for a
            few minutes till the oil begins to leave the sides of the masala
            paste.
          </li>
          <li>
            The cashew paste will begin to cook fast. Approx 3 to 4 minutes on a
            low flame. So keep stirring non-stop.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>making Paneer Butter Masala</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Add water and mix very well. Simmer on a low flame.</li>
          <li>The curry will come to a boil.</li>
          <li>
            After 2 to 3 minutes of boiling, add ginger julienne. Reserve a few
            for garnishing. The curry will also begin to thicken.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add julienned ginger and green chillies, salt and sugar and simmer
            till the curry begins to thicken.
          </li>
          <li>
            After 3 to 4 minutes, add slit green chillies. also add salt as per
            taste and ½ to 1 teaspoon sugar (optional).
          </li>
          <li>
            You can vary the sugar quantity from ¼ tsp to 1 teaspoon or more
            depending on the sourness of the tomatoes. Sugar is optional and you
            can skip it too. If you add cream, then you will need to add less
            sugar.
          </li>
          <li>Mix very well and simmer for a minute.</li>
          <li>
            After the gravy thickens to your desired consistency, then add the
            paneer cubes and stir gently. I keep the gravy to a medium
            consistency.
          </li>
          <li>
            After that add crushed kasuri methi (dry fenugreek leaves), garam
            masala and cream. Gently mix and then switch off the flame.
          </li>
        </ol>
